XDRAntivirusWhat is Antivirus?Antivirus is software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware)from computers and networks.Purpose of Antivirus:The primary purpose is to protect systems from viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, andother malware by scanning files and monitoring system activity.Where Antivirus is Helpful:It is helpful in protecting personal computers, corporate networks, servers, and mobiledevices from malware attacks.Real-time Example of Antivirus:Using antivirus software like Norton, McAfee, or Windows Defender to scan and remove avirus downloaded from an email attachment.AntiransomwareWhat is Antiransomware?Antiransomware is specialized software designed to prevent and mitigate ransomwareattacks that encrypt files and demand ransom.Purpose of Antiransomware:To detect ransomware behavior, block encryption attempts, and protect sensitive data.Where Antiransomware is Helpful:It is useful in industries like healthcare, finance, and government sectors, where data iscritical.Real-time Example of Antiransomware:Using tools like Malwarebytes or Sophos Intercept X to stop ransomware like WannaCry orREvil.Phishing ProtectionWhat is Phishing Protection?It is a security mechanism that detects and blocks phishing attempts, which aim to stealsensitive information like passwords and credit card details.Why Do We Need Phishing Protection?To prevent financial loss, data breaches, and identity theft caused by phishing scams.Where is Phishing Protection Useful?In email systems, web browsers, and corporate networks to block phishing URLs.Real-time Example of Phishing Protection:A browser extension or email filter blocking a fake PayPal login page designed to steal usercredentials.Browsing ProtectionWhat is Browsing Protection?It is a feature that protects users from accessing malicious or harmful websites.Why Do We Need Browsing Protection?To prevent malware infections, phishing attacks, and data leaks from unsafe websites.Where is Browsing Protection Useful?In corporate environments and personal devices to ensure safe internet usage.Real-time Example of Browsing Protection:Using Safe Browsing features in Google Chrome or extensions like Web of Trust (WOT).Firewall ProtectionWhat is Firewall Protection?A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoingtrafic based on predefined security rules.Why Do We Need Firewall Protection?To block unauthorized access, prevent data breaches, and ensure network security.Where is Firewall Protection Useful?In enterprise networks, home routers, and cloud-based systems.Real-time Example of Firewall Protection:Using Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) like Check Point or Palo Alto to monitor traficbetween internal servers and the internet.Email ProtectionWhat is Email Protection?It is a security measure to safeguard email communication from threats like phishing, spam,and malware.Why Do We Need Email Protection?To prevent data breaches, ransomware attacks, and phishing attempts via email.Where is Email Protection Useful?In corporate email systems and personal email accounts.Real-time Example of Email Protection:Using tools like Mimecast or Microsoft Defender for Ofice 365 to block phishing emails.Application ControlPurpose of Application Control:To restrict or allow applications based on security policies.Where Application Control is Helpful:In enterprise environments to prevent unauthorized or malicious applications from running.Real-time Example of Application Control:Using tools like AppLocker or McAfee Application Control to block unauthorized softwareinstallations.Malware-based AttacksTypes:Virus: Infects files and spreads when executed.Worm: Self-replicating malware that spreads without user interaction.Spyware: Monitors user activity and sends data to attackers.Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands ransom.Trojans: Disguised as legitimate software.Adware: Displays unwanted advertisements.Social Engineering AttacksTypes:Phishing: Fake emails or websites to steal data.Spear Phishing: Targeted phishing attacks.Smishing: Phishing via SMS.Vishing: Phishing via voice calls.Baiting: Ofering something enticing to steal data.Whaling: Targeting high-profile individuals.DoS AttacksTypes:DDoS Attack: Distributed Denial of Service using multiple systems.Ping Flood: Overloading a server with ping requests.SYN Flood: Exploiting the TCP handshake process.Password AttacksTypes:Brute Force: Trying all possible combinations of passwords.Keylogging: Recording keystrokes to steal passwords.Dictionary Attack: Using a list of common passwords.Rainbow Table Attack: Using precomputed hash values.Credential Stufing: Using leaked credentials from one system to access another.Man-in-the-Middle AttacksTypes:Eavesdropping: Intercepting communication.Session Hijacking: Taking over a user’s session.Wi-Fi Spoofing: Fake Wi-Fi networks to steal data.IP Spoofing: Impersonating a trusted IP address.IoT-based AttacksTypes:Botnet: Compromised IoT devices used for attacks.Firmware Exploits: Exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT firmware.Default Credentials: Using factory-set passwords to gain access.SQL Injection & Code Injection AttacksTypes:SQL Injection: Injecting SQL queries into input fields.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.Command Injection: Executing arbitrary commands on a server.LDAP Injection: Exploiting LDAP queries.Insider ThreatsTypes:Malicious: Deliberate harm by employees.Negligent: Unintentional harm due to carelessness.Third-party Risk: Risks from vendors or contractors.Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)Types:Espionage: Stealing sensitive data.Sabotage: Disrupting operations.Zero-day Exploits: Attacking unknown vulnerabilities.CryptojackingTypes:Browser-based: Mining cryptocurrency through malicious scripts in web browsers.File-based: Infecting systems with mining malware.Physical AttacksTypes:Theft: Stealing physical devices.Shoulder Surfing: Observing sensitive information over someone’s shoulder.Dumpster Diving: Retrieving confidential information from trash.Social Media AttacksTypes:Impersonation: Creating fake profiles.Fake Giveaways: Luring users to share sensitive information.DNS SpoofingTypes:DNS Hijacking: Redirecting trafic to malicious websites.Cache Poisoning: Injecting false DNS entries into a cache.AI-powered AttacksTypes:Deepfake: Using AI to create fake videos or audio.AI-driven Phishing: Using AI to create convincing phishing attacks.Supply Chain AttacksTypes:Hardware: Compromising hardware components.Software: Injecting malware into software updates.SnifingTypes:Packet Snifing: Intercepting network trafic.Wiretapping: Monitoring
